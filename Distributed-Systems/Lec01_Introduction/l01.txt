6.824: Distributed Systems Engineering

What is a distributed system?
  multiple cooperating computers
  DNS, P2P file sharing, big databases, MapReduce, &c
  lots of critical infrastructure is distributed!

Why distribute?
  to connect physically separate entities
  to achieve security via isolation
  to tolerate faults via replication
  to scale up throughput via parallel CPUs/mem/disk/net

But:
  complex: many concurrent parts
  must cope with partial failure
  tricky to realize performance potential

Why take this course?
  interesting -- hard problems, non-obvious solutions
  used by real systems -- driven by the rise of big Web sites
  active research area -- lots of progress + big unsolved problems
  hands-on -- you'll build serious systems in the labs

MAIN TOPICS

This is a course about infrastructure, to be used by applications.
  About abstractions that hide complexity of distribution from applications.
  Three big kinds of abstraction:
    Storage.
    Communication.
    Computation.
  A couple of topics come up repeatedly.

Topic: implementation
  RPC, threads, concurrency control.

Topic: performance
  The dream: scalable throughput.
    Nx servers -> Nx total throughput via parallel CPU, disk, net.
    So handling more load only requires buying more computers.
  Scaling gets progressively harder:
    Load balance, stragglers.
    "Small" non-parallelizable parts.
    Hidden shared resources, e.g. network.

Topic: fault tolerance
  1000s of server, complex net -> always something broken
  We'd like to hide these failures from the application.
  We often want:
    Availability -- I can keep using my files despite failures
    Durability -- my data will come back to life when failures are repaired
  Big idea: replicated servers.
    If one server crashes, client can proceed using the other.

Topic: consistency
  General-purpose infrastructure needs well-defined behavior.
    E.g. "Get(k) yields the value from the most recent Put(k,v)."
  Achieving good behavior is hard!
    Clients submit concurrent operations.
    Servers crash at awkward moments.
    Network may make live servers look dead; risk of "split brain".
  Consistency and performance are enemies.
    Consistency requires communication, e.g. to get latest Put().
    Systems with pleasing ("strict") semantics are often slow.
    Fast systems often make applications cope with complex ("relaxed") behavior.
  People have pursued many design points in this spectrum.

CASE STUDY: MapReduce

Let's talk about MapReduce (MR) as a case study
  MR is a good illustration of 6.824's main topics
  and is the focus of Lab 1

MapReduce overview
  context: multi-hour computations on multi-terabyte data-sets
    e.g. experimental analyses of structure of crawled web pages
    often not developed by distributed systems enthusiasts
    can be very painful, e.g. coping with failure
  overall goal: non-specialist programmers can easily solve giant
    data processing problems with reasonable efficiency.
  programmer defines Map and Reduce functions
    sequential code; often fairly simple
  MR runs the functions on 1000s of machines with huge inputs
    and hides all details of distribution
  
Abstract view of MapReduce
  input is divided into "splits"
  Input Map -> a,1 b,1 c,1
  Input Map ->     b,1
  Input Map -> a,1     c,1
                |   |   |
                    |   -> Reduce -> c,2
                    -----> Reduce -> b,2
  MR calls Map() on each split, produces set of k2,v2
    "intermediate" data
  MR gathers all intermediate v2's for a given k2,
    and passes them to a Reduce call
  final output is set of <k2,v3> pairs from Reduce()

Example: word count
  input is thousands of text files
  Map(k, v)
    split v into words
    for each word w
      emit(w, "1")
  Reduce(k, v)
    emit(len(v))

This model is easy to program; it hides many painful details:
  concurrency -- same result as sequential execution
  starting s/w on servers
  data movement
  failures

This model scales well.
  Nx computers get you Nx Map() and Reduce() throughput.
    Map()s don't wait for each other or share data, can run in parallel.
    Same for Reduce()s.
    Up to a point...
  So you can get more throughput by buying more computers.
    Rather than special-purpose efficient parallelizations of each application.
    Computers are much cheaper than programmers!

What will be the limiting factor in performance?
  We care since that's the thing to optimize.
  CPU? memory? disk? network?
  They were limited by "network cross-section bandwidth".
    [diagram: map servers, network box, reduce servers]
    The network's total internal capacity.
    Often much smaller than sum of host network link speeds.
  Hard to build a network than can run 1000x faster than a single computer.
  So they cared about minimizing movement of data over the network.

What about fault tolerance?
  I.e. what if a server crashes during a MR job?
  Hiding failures is a huge part of ease of programming!
  Why not re-start the whole job from the beginning?
  MR re-runs just the failed Map()s and Reduce()s.
    They are pure functions -- they don't modify their inputs,
      they don't keep state, there's no shared memory, there's
      no map/map or reduce/reduce interaction.
    So re-execution is likely to yield the same output.
  The requirement for pure functions is a major limitation of
    MR compared to other parallel programming schemes.
    But it's critical to MR's simplicity.

More details (paper's Figure 1):
  master: gives tasks to workers; remembers where intermediate output is
  M input splits
  input stored in GFS, 3 copies of each split
  all computers run both GFS and MR workers
  many more input splits than workers
  master starts a Map task on each server
    hands out new tasks as old ones finish
  worker hashes Map output by key into R partitions, on local disk
  no Reduce calls until all Maps are finished
  master tells Reducers to fetch intermediate data partitions from Map workers
  Reduce workers write final output to GFS

How does detailed design help network performance?
  Map input is read from local disks, not over network.
  Intermediate data goes over network just once.
    Stored on local disk, not GFS.
  Intermediate data partitioned into files holding many keys.
    Big network transfers are more efficient.

How do they get good load balance?
  Critical to scaling -- otherwise Nx servers -> no gain.
  But time to process a split or partition isn't uniform.
    Different sizes and contents, and different server hardware.
  Solution: many more splits than workers.
    Master hands out new splits to workers who finish previous tasks.
    So no split is so big it dominates completion time (hopefully).
    So faster servers do more work than slower ones, finish abt the same time.

How does MR cope with worker crashes?
  * Map worker crashes:
    master re-runs, spreads tasks over other GFS replicas of input.
      even if worker had finished, since still need intermediate data on disk.
    some Reduce workers may already have read failed worker's intermediate data.
      here we depend on functional and deterministic Map()!
    how does the master know the worker crashed? (pings)
    master need not re-run Map if Reduces have fetched all intermediate data
      though then a Reduce crash would have to wait for Maps to re-run
  * Reduce worker crashes before producing output.
    master re-starts its tasks on another worker.
  * Reduce worker crashes in the middle of writing its output.
    GFS has atomic rename that prevents output from being visible until complete.
    so it's safe for the master to re-run the Reduce tasks somewhere else.

Other failures/problems:
  * What if the master accidentally starts *two* Map() workers on same input?
    it will tell Reduce workers about only one of them.
  * What if two Reduce() workers for the same partition of intermediate data?
    they will both try to write the same output file on GFS!
    atomic GFS rename will cause the second to finish to win.
  * What if a single worker is very slow -- a "straggler"?
    perhaps due to flakey hardware.
    master starts a second copy of last few tasks.
  * What if a worker computes incorrect output, due to broken h/w or s/w?
    too bad! MR assumes "fail-stop" CPUs and software.
  * What if the master crashes?

For what applications *doesn't* MapReduce work well?
  Not everything fits the map/shuffle/reduce pattern.
  Small data, since overheads are high. E.g. not web site back-end.
  Small updates to big data, e.g. add a few documents to a big index
  Unpredictable reads (neither Map nor Reduce can choose input)
  Multiple shuffles, e.g. page-rank (can use multiple MR but not very efficient)
  More flexible systems allow these, but more complex model.

Conclusion
  MapReduce single-handedly made big cluster computation popular.
  - Not the most efficient or flexible.
  + Scales well.
  + Easy to program -- failures and data movement are hidden.
  These were good trade-offs in practice.
  We'll see some more advanced successors later in the course.
  Have fun with the lab!
